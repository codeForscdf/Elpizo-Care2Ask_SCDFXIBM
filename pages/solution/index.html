						<p> The problem statement we have choosen to undertake is a multifaceted problem that raises a plethora of underlying issues. As such, it would be impossible to tackle such
							dynamic problems with a one-size-fit-all panacea that many other teams woud have no doubt attempted to implement.
							Our solutions consists of a few elements supporting those displayed from our 2 minutes long video pitch, such as a login page for the family of
						disabled elderly to upload pictures and contact information, as well as a glossary of medical terms for the public to use to quickly understand medical conditions without running
					into more medical terminology.</p>

										<h2>AskOps Chatbot</h2>
									</header>
									<p> Our first solution aims to address the issue that some Community First Responders (CFRs) might need more information regarding how to deal with cases at scene and they need such information fast.
										We therefore present AskOPs, an application that has a chatbot equipped with simplified versions of protocols for medical, trauma and HAZMAT emergencies. Further application might develope into equipping
									the chatbot with SCDF's SOPs for the frontliners to have easier access to the procedural norms that govern the operation of the organisation, such as meal times, IPPT clearance and process
								to take leave. More in depth analysis can be found in our <b><a href="https://codeforscdf.github.io/Elpizo-Care2Ask_SCDFXIBM/pages/reflections.html">Reflections page</a></b>.</p>

<h2>Happy Sundowning</h2>
<span class="image"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTwFM_pKdh3tJSm6l6DJPjUMc_TrT2ZT-lyL3ppjUzEVKGE5RRz&usqp=CAUs" alt="" /></span>

<p>Sundowning is a symptom of late stage dementia, and we hope to make it easier on the family for those suffering from similar debilitating conditions that
	are on the rise risethrough thus application. </p>
<p>Firstly, there is a registration and upload page, together with a Terms and Condition of use,
	for family members of any mentally or physically disabled elderly to consensually upload one picture (or up to 3 pictures for higher accuracy)
so that members of public can make use of this database of faces in times of emergency. These utilities available for family members to upload
more pictures of their love ones and update personal particulars as well as additional instructions
will be hash encrypted and password protected, stored in an encrypted database for security reasons.</p>
<p>Next, there is a public user interface for Community First Responders (CFRs) to upload a picture of the patient for comparison using the highly accurate AWS Rekognition programme.
The member of public can get the phone number, name and additional information about the condition of the patient as consented by the patient's family. This will allow them
to make a more accurate assessment of the situation and take more decisive actions based on instructions from the next-of-kin. Once a facial recognition match is confirmed,
that CFR can either call/SMS the NOK of the lost elderly, if the NOK consents to having their contact shares. Alternatively, a push notification can be sent to the mobile phone of the
NOK containing details of the location where their love one has been found shouldd they choose to keep their contact number private. As such, Care2Ask application acts as a secure gateway and
middle-man in setting up a safe environment for the public to help one another.</p>

<h2>Medify</h2>
								<p class="content">
									Medify is an application for these CFRs to translate convoluted medical documents into simplified text. We tried to use OCR technology such as Google Vision and AWS Rekognition
									for these people to upload their documents and have the text extracted from them. However, the high volume of text uploaded might be translated into highly inaccurate pieces,
									and hence, we came up with a database and created a user-friendly platform for these users to upload the particular words or phrase they can't comprehend. Through these translations,
									we will ease their confusion and give them more confidence to step forward in assisting with such a useful tool within arm's reach. Below is a step by step portrayal of how the situation
								might play out for the CFRs when dealing with a vulnerable and old patient.</p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li>
									<span class="icon solid major style1 fa-heartbeat"></span>
									<h3>Get the Document</h3>
									<p>Elderly patient presents to random member of public a document. Patient seems to be have trouble communicating symptoms and can only sign anxiously with flailing arms.  One of the arms look broken and out of shape.</p>
								</li>
								<li><span class="icon solid major style3 fa-briefcase"></span>
									<h3>Pick out the Words</h3>
									<p>Member of public tries to Google the document that she has trouble deciphering. Google bombards her with news, videos, similar conditions, treatments alien to the average Singapore ear. The patient and kind soul start to grow fustrated.</h5>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li><span class="icon solid major style5 fa-wind"></span>
									<h3>Translate the Text</h3>
									<p> Another member of public walks past and sees the growing exasperation. Whipping out her phone and accessing the myResponder app,
										he accesses the Medify database created by team Elpizo and happily finds out that the elderly is a dialysis patient and what looks like a disformed arm is an AV shunt.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p> Medify is incorporated onto a dynamic page together with the other applications this solution contains and can be accessed <a href="https://www.alg3bras.com/Manning365">here</a>.
