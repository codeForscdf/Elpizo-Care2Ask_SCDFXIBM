    Welcome to Team Elpizo's webpage.
    As part of the SCDFxIBM Innovation Challenge 2020,
    we will discuss the everchanging problem Singapore faces in the area of emergency response.
<br/><br/><p>
  Recent advances in cloud technologies have created opportunities to ease the operations of many sectors.
  Are these cloud technologies just a replacement for FTPs and VMs?
  Or can it's wide arrays of APIs and SDKs be used too in managing Singapore's pursuit to be a smart nation?

      <h2>The Problem Statements</h2>
    </div><p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
      <ul><li><h4>EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES</h4>
        SCDF works closely with Community First Responders (CFRs) to provide timely relief and response to
        emergency situations. With the increasingly aging population and a growing segment of vulnerable
        populations in mind (e.g. increasing trend of elderly with no next of kin), how might we leverage
        analytics for better sense-making to be alerted at the onset of incidents which require emergency
        response (e.g. cardiac arrests, falls, unattended cooking fires etc.) and mobilise CFRs for effective
        early intervention especially to the vulnerable populations?</li><br/>
              <li><h4>CLIMATE CHANGE</h4>
                Climate change is inevitable, with projected increase in temperatures leading to phenomena such as
                the Urban Heat Island effect. This leads to an environment and climate where it is increasingly
                physically challenging for First Responders to train and operate to maximum efficiency and
                performance. How might SCDF leverage wearables or other technologies to provide relief or
                enhancement in harsh operating conditions and maximise the safety, health and performance of
                First Responders during training and operations?</li><br/>
                  <li><h4>INTERGRATING WITH A SMART ENVIRONMENT</h4>
                    Infrastructure is getting “smart”, with sensors and Internet of things (IoT) increasingly embedded in
                    the built environment (e.g. Punggol Digital District). How might we leverage a network of smart
                    infrastructure in the built environment to make better and more timely sense of emergency
                    incidents (e.g. detection of fires developing, building collapses, falls, road traffic accidents etc.) and
                    to trigger early intervention measures, without the need to activate precious emergency resources?</li><br/>
                      <li><h4>PREVENTING THE SPREAD</h4>
                        Recent events such as the protracted wildfires in Australia and the outbreak of COVID-19 suggests
                        that across the globe, we are indeed heading toward a decade of new frontiers in 2020s which has
                        implications on civil defence, community resilience and emergency response in Singapore. How
                        might we leverage technology to project and come up with upstream solutions to make such events
                        non-events?</li></ul><br/><br/>

      <h2>Resources Our Final Solution Uses</h2>
      <p></p></div>

<div class="row"><div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6"><div class="service-box"><div class="service-icon yellow">
  <a href="https://www.github.com" title="GitHub"><h3 style="color:black;">GitHub</h3>
  </div><div class="service-content"><h3>GitHub</h3>
    <p style="text-align:left;">A great space to store code and share them in organised folders,
      so that our team can simultaneously work together on one project.
      The ease of collaboration stems from GitHub's ergonomic design.
      Their great integrations with many applications allow us to work seemlessly.</p></a>
      </div></div></div>

<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6"><div class="service-box"><div class="service-icon orange">
  <a href="https://www.atom.io" title="Atom.io"><h3 style="color:black;">Atom.io</h3>
  </div><div class="service-content"><h3>Atom.io</h3>
    <p style="text-align:left;">Atom.io is an amazing code editor where we all code our applications
      before compiling in an IDE and then uploading to server via FTP.
      Atom.io is heavily customisable based on individual preferences and
      has neat features to allow collaborations.</p></a>
      </div></div></div>

<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6"><div class="service-box "><div class="service-icon red">
    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/" title="AWS Services"><h3 style="color:black;">AWS Rekognition</h3>
    </div><div class="service-content"><h3>AWS Rekognition</h3>
      <p style="text-align:left;">We use AWS Rekognition to run the comparison of faces for our Happy Sundowning application.
        It's high accuracy in facial detection and comparison even in pictures
        with low quality is a powerful tool we created for the public
        to help our society's pertinent issue of an ageing population.</p></a>
      </div></div></div>

  </div><div class="service-content"><h3>Google Vision</h3>
    <p style="text-align:left;"> We worked with this optical character recognition tool to extract tough words to convert with Medify,
      an application in our solution, convertin complex text into comprehensible text.
      This translation aims to help CFRs better understand patient conditions
      and promote transparency in the healthcare sector.</p></a>

<div class="row"><div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6"><div class="service-box"><div class="service-icon blue">
  <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/" title="IBM Cloud"><h3 style="color:black;">IBM Cloud</h3>
  </div><div class="service-content"><h3>IBM Cloud</h3>
    <p style="text-align:left;">A store for many other softwares, IBM Cloud makes it easy to incorporate the many AI tools into our programmes.
      We worked on phpmyadmin on IBM, as well used IBM's Db2 database on their cloud before deploying to our servers. All in all, it is a host
    for a plethora of applications to connect together.</p></a>
  </div></div></div>

<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6"><div class="service-box"><div class="service-icon green">
  <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-assistant/" title="Watson Assistant"><h3 style="color:black;">IBM Watson Assistant</h3>
  </div><div class="service-content"><h3>IBM Watson Assistant</h3>
    <p style="text-align:left;" style="color:white;">We've taught IBM's Watson Assistant SCDF's SOPs
    and the medical protocols, coupling with IBM's Speech to Text capabilities.
    This is to provide quick information to paramedics out on scene attending to cases.
    It is an easy application to create but has an even bigger application on the field.</p></a>
  </div></div></div>

<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6"><div class="service-box "><div class="service-icon violet">
  <h3 style="color:black;">Miscellaneous 1</h3>
</div><div class="service-content"><h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
  <p style="text-align:left;">Members of Elpizo used different
    IDEs like Eclipse, Cyberduck and Visual Studios, to code our applications.
    We used MySql software tool to store user inputs, and IBM's Apache to run dynamic code locally before deployment.
    Different video editing softwares such as Filmora and Blender, were used to create our video.</p>
  </div></div></div>

    <p style="text-align:left;">Over the course of the short two days of the challenge,
      many different other programmes and softwares, such as Firebase, IBM Medical Annotator,
      Node Red and AWS Robomaker, were tried but progress was slow in those areas.
      However, Elpizo do have learning points from these trials and our notes can be accessed <a href="/Elpizo-Care2Ask_SCDFXIBM/pages/tutorials.md">here</a>.</p>
